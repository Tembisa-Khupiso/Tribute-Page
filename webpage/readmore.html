			<p><strong>Stylist and jewellery designer</strong> who is a community activist, working with young minds to design beautiful outfits using old stuff. Concepts by Kaya is a creative agency founded by Cape Town based Fashion stylist and jewellery de-signer, Concepts by Kaya started as an eco-friendly accessories brand that weds both art and fashion by strictly using recycled materials to create eccentric pieces installing allusions of afro-modernism and Afro symbolism. Through my community work the brand has grown to be a socio-economic movement for young people which focuses on artistic expression as a vehicle and medium to change the typical narrative of youth from underprivileged backgrounds. I have collaborated with three non-profit organisations, namely; Sesona Sibane HIV&AIDS program, Vocal Revolutionaries and Youth Matters movement on a campaign called #Upcycled. The campaign focuses on recycling, we aim to raise awareness on recycling and promote ethical eco -friendly fashion. It’s a new spin on in-novative thinking, deeply rooted on solution based thinking, understanding that something old can breathe newness.</p>

			 <p class="para2"><q>In order for this aim to be achieved effectively and practically, there needs to be innovative ways to fundraise and bring about awareness around this (these) issue. The campaign is divided into three spheres namely art, music and culture. Through these spheres we hope to inspire, influence and proactively make a change by engaging the youth through theses respective spheres. Each depart-ment that stems from the three spheres will come together and formulate a plan of action that will raise enough funds to make sure the end goal of this collaboration is achieved. <strong>By Kaya Mtengwane</strong></q></p>

			<p><strong>We</strong> aim to breed a lifestyle and culture that will spark minds of influence, through this we aspire to inspire and enkindle young individuals and inform the public about policies, i.e. sexuality education policies. The fundamental aspect of the campaign is to #SanitizeASister #SanitizeAbrother, this cam-paign will give birth to ‘The boy/girl child’ mentorship program that will be an intervention in ad-dressing young people’s human rights coming from dysfunctional backgrounds; change the typical narrative of underprivileged children; work towards creating a rainbow nation of substance and a na-tion that one can be proud of and one that resonates and inspires a young person to dream and de-sire a life beyond their circumstances, one with meaning that transcends and connects all youth from all backgrounds and diversities. We wish to uphold an everlasting legacy of Ubuntu where young people come together to influence change into their lives, others and those who can’t do it for themselves. We believe that donation is the core value and principle of Ubuntu, as it has been a way of life in African Culture - one must have a hand in making a society prosperous.</p>
